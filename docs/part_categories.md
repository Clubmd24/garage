# Managing Part Categories

The office interface lets you define categories that can be assigned to parts.
To view or modify them, open `/office/parts/categories` after logging in.

## Creating categories

Use the **New category** field at the top of the page to enter a name and click
**Add**. The list below will refresh with the new entry.

## Editing categories

Renaming categories isn't currently available through the UI. To change a name
remove the old category and create a new one with the desired title.

## Deleting categories

Press the **Delete** button next to a category and confirm the prompt. Parts
referencing the category will keep their association but the category will no
longer appear in the list.
