-- Database Cleanup Status Migration
-- This migration records that we've attempted cleanup and provides guidance
-- Table cleanup requires manual foreign key analysis first

-- Record this cleanup attempt
INSERT INTO `schema_migrations` (`version`, `description`, `executed_at`) 
VALUES ('20260116_cleanup_unused_tables_safe', 'Database cleanup attempted - requires manual foreign key analysis', NOW())
ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE `executed_at` = NOW();

-- Note: Table removal requires manual foreign key analysis first
-- Even development tables appear to have foreign key relationships
-- Next steps:
-- 1. Run foreign key analysis script to understand dependencies
-- 2. Manually identify and remove safe tables
-- 3. Create targeted cleanup migrations based on analysis
